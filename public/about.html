      Bob Marley and the Wailers were a Jamaican reggae band led by Bob Marley. It developed from the earlier ska vocal group,
      the Wailers, created by Marley with Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer in 1963. By late 1963 singers Junior Braithwaite,
      Beverley Kelso, and Cherry Smith had joined on. By the early 1970s, Marley and Bunny Wailer had learned to play some
      instruments and brothers Aston "Family Man" Barrett (bass) and Carlton Barrett (drums), had joined the band. After Bunny
      Wailer and Peter Tosh left the band in 1974, Marley began touring with new band members. His new backing band included
      the Barrett brothers, Junior Marvin and Al Anderson on lead guitar, Tyrone Downie and Earl "Wya" Lindo on keyboards, and
      Alvin "Seeco" Patterson on percussion. The "I Threes", consisting of Judy Mowatt, Marcia Griffiths, and Marley's wife,
      Rita, provided backing vocals.The Wailers were formed when self-taught musician Hubert Winston McIntosh (Peter Tosh) met the singers Neville
      Livingston (Bunny Wailer), and Robert Nesta Marley (Bob Marley) in 1963.

      The lineup was known variously as the Teenagers, the Wailing Rudeboys, the Wailing Wailers and finally just the Wailers.
      The original lineup featured Junior Braithwaite on vocals, Bob Marley on guitar, Peter Tosh on keyboard, Neville
      Livingston (a.k.a. Bunny Wailer) on percussion, and Cherry Smith and Beverley Kelso on backing vocals. By 1966
      Braithwaite, Kelso and Smith had left the band, which then consisted of the trio Livingston, Marley and Tosh.
      
      In 1964, the Wailers topped the Jamaican charts with "Simmer Down", which was recorded 1963 at Studio One with the
      rhythm section from studio house band The Skatalites. Some of the Wailers' most notable songs were recorded with Lee
      "Scratch" Perry and his studio band the Upsetters. The Wailers also worked with renowned reggae producer Leslie Kong,
      who used his studio musicians called Beverley's All-Stars (Jackie Jackson, Paul Douglas, Gladstone Anderson, Winston
      Wright, Rad Bryan, Hux Brown) to record the songs that would be released as an album titled The Best of The Wailers.
      
      In 1966, they created a rocksteady record label, the Wail N Soul M.
      
      During the early 1970s the Upsetters members Aston "Family Man" Barrett and his brother Carlton (Carly) Barrett,
      formed the Wailers Band, providing instrumental backing for The Wailers. The Wailers recorded groundbreaking ska and
      reggae songs such as "Simmer Down", "Trenchtown Rock", "Nice Time", "War", "Stir It Up" and "Get Up, Stand Up". An
      attempt at creating a full overview of all the music made by The Wailers prior to their signing to Island Records was
      made by the Roots Reggae Library.
